# Python-digit-image-Recognizer-
4th Year Emerging Technologies Flask/Python Web App to recognize Digits From Images

## Project 2017
The following are instructions to complete the project for the module Emerging Technologies for 2017. This project is worth 40% of your marks for the module.

## Overview

In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. You should use tensorflow and flask to do this. Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.

## Instructions

Create a git repository with a README.md and an appropriate gitignore file. The README should explain who you are, why you created the application, how you created it, how to download and run it, and summarise any references you have used.
In the repository, create a web application that serves a HTML page as the root resource. The page should contain an input where the user can upload (or draw) an image containing a digit, and an area to display the image and the digit.
Add a route to your application that accepts requests containing a user input image and responds with the digit.
Connect the HTML page to the route using AJAX.
